## Winnipeg C++ Developers - January 2026

![January 2026 Meetup](/images/event.jpeg)

Mark your calendars! Our January meetup is scheduled and we'd love to see you there.

### Event Details

**Date:** Thursday, January 22, 2026  
**Time:** 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM CST  
**Location:** Bill and Helen Norrie Library  
15 Poseidon Bay, Winnipeg, MB R3M 3E4

### What to Expect

Welcome to Winnipeg C++ Developers!

We're doing it again, talking all about the C++ STL algorithms! Some you may know, and some you may not know yet!

This is open to those who are interested in the C++ programming language, whether you work with it professionally or
as a hobby. We'll begin on topic, but we're happy to diverge, even to programming languages other than C++.

If this piques your interest, then please join us!
