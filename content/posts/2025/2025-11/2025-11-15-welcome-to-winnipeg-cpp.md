## Building a C++ Community in Winnipeg

Welcome to the Winnipeg C++ Developers user group! We're a community of developers passionate about modern 
C++, systems programming, and software engineering. Whether you're a seasoned C++ expert or just starting 
your journey with the language, you'll find a welcoming environment to learn, share, and connect with 
fellow developers.

## What We're About

Our meetups bring together local developers to discuss C++ best practices, explore new language features, 
share war stories from the trenches, and learn from each other's experiences. We believe in hands-on 
learning, practical demonstrations, and fostering a supportive community where questions are encouraged 
and knowledge is freely shared.

## Monthly Gatherings

We meet monthly at various locations around Winnipeg. Each meetup typically includes technical talks, live 
coding sessions, or group discussions on topics ranging from modern C++ standards (C++20, C++23) to 
performance optimization, design patterns, and real-world problem solving.

## Get Involved

Follow our event announcements to stay updated on upcoming meetups. Registration is free and open to all 
skill levels. We're always looking for speakers, so if you have a topic you're passionate about or a 
project you'd like to share, please reach out!

See you at the next meetup!
