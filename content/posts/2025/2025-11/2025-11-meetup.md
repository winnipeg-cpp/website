## Winnipeg C++ Developers - November 2025

![November 2025 Meetup](/images/event.jpeg)

Mark your calendars! Our November meetup is scheduled and we'd love to see you there.

Do you know all of the C++ STL algorithms? Thursday next week, November 20th, 2025, let's talk about the C++ STL algorithms. The common ones, the not-so-common ones, and everything in between. This was a request from one of our regular attendees, so the suggestion is much appreciated! 😀

### Event Details

**Date:** Thursday, November 20, 2025  
**Time:** 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM CST  
**Location:** Bill and Helen Norrie Library  
15 Poseidon Bay, Winnipeg, MB R3M 3E4

### What to Expect

Join us for an evening of C++ discussions, knowledge sharing, and networking with fellow developers from 
the Winnipeg area. This is a great opportunity to meet other C++ enthusiasts, learn something new, and 
contribute to our growing community.

applications, you'll find kindred spirits who understand the challenges and joys of working with C++.
